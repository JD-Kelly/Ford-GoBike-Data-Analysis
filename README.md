# Ford GoBike Exploration

## Dataset

> The data ended up containg 448489 rows and 16 columns after an inital wrangling and cleaning process. I used the dataset which focussed on the city of San Francisco during the period of June to Decmeber of 2017. As the bike scheme only came to San Fransico at the end of June there is not a full years worth of data.


## Summary of Findings

> During the exploration of the dataset I focussed in on gender initially but soon discovered there was simialr trends across male, female and other gender categories. However it was noted that females took slightly longer rides. Where there was more noticeable differences was in the two user types - Subscirber and Customer. For subscribers it was shown that most trips took place at 8am and 5pm during the week, with a sharp drop off during the middle of the day and at the weekend. For customers there was a similar peak at 8am and 5pm, however there was less of drop off during the middle of the day and the highest amount of rides took place on the weekend. The difference in the amount of users and duration is likely due to to subscribers being from the area and commuting to and from work, while customers being tourists or occassional riders using bikes to explore the city.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation I'll be walking through the June to December 2017 period. I'll be mainly focussing on the user types of Subscriber and Customer to highlight the customer trends. I'll firstly show the split in user type before looking at their ride duration and number of bike trips - broken into hourly, weekly and monthly.
